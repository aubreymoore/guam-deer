## Independent Observations or a Single Deer?

If we estimate that the frequency of observing deer swimming in the ocean around Guam  is once every one hundred days, we can use the Poisson distribution to calculate the probability of 2 or more independent observations on the same day. The calculated probability is only 0.00005, which is equivalent to only one chance in 20,000.
